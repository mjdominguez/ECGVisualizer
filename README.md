# ECG Visualizer v0.96

# Description

This project presents a tool for visualization, filtering, PQRST peaks automatic detection and reports generation using the xml files provided by the General Electric CardioSoft 12SL.

The project is under continuous development and, for now, only contemplates automatic filtering and automatic peak detection based on predefined PR, QRS and QT intervals.

Future versions will allow the application of filters in the order the user wants, as well as greater customization for the filtering, peaks detection and report generation processes.

It is very important to point out that this tool has been developed expressly for the automation of the process of generating reports on ECGs taken on high-performance athletes. This aspect is important since, in this type of people, the intervals on which the detection of peaks is based are considerably different from those of ordinary people. These aspects and others about the operation of the tool are indicated in the "help" menu of the tool.

In order to test the tool functionaloty, a couple of anonymized xmls are provided.

Here you are some captures from the software tool:
